Easy and Abstracted gRPC. A collection of utilities for making GRPC easier to use in python. This package is widely used within Kensho.

`pip install eagr`

## Server

Functionality to simplify running grpc services. Provides a common set of metrics and logging


### Sample usage:

```python
import time
from eagr import (
    GRPCBase,
    run_grpc_servers,
)


# UserServicer is from generated proto
class UserService(GRPCBase, UserServicer):
    # Set to generated proto add_<>_to_server function
    _REGISTRAR = None

    def Create(self, request, context):
        return User(name='louis')


def start_server():
    user_service = UserService()
    with run_grpc_servers((user_service,), grpc_port=9000, metrics_port=9001):
        while True:
            print("Server running.")
            time.sleep(100)
```


## Client

Functionality to simplify instantiating a client as well as wrapping it with metrics, logging, etc

### Sample usage:

```python
from eagr import make_grpc_client

from your_service_pb2_gprc import YourServiceStub


client = make_grpc_client(
    "client group for metrics", "service name", "service url", YourServiceStub
)
```


## REST Passthrough

[Functionality to bind unary grpc methods to Flask handlers](eagr/flask_bridge/Readme.md)


## Unittest Server


Functionality to create an in-process server for unittesting


### Sample usage:


```python
import unittest
from unittest.mock import MagicMock

from eagr import inprocess_grpc_server, make_grpc_client

from your_service_pb2_gprc import YourServicer, YourServiceStub, add_YourServicer_to_server


class TestMyClient(unittest.TestClient):

    def test_something(self):
        mock_servicer = MagicMock(YourServicer)
        mock_servicer.FooBar = lambda x, _: x
        with inprocess_grpc_server(mock_servicer, add_YourServicer_to_server) as address:
            client = make_grpc_client("foo", "bar", address, YourServiceStub)
            baz = <your input here>
            self.assertEqual(baz, client.FooBar(baz))
```


## GRPC Reflection Interface

Functionality to create a generic GRPC client based on a GRPC server that has reflection enabled

### Sample usage:

```python
from eagr.reflection import grpc_reflection_interface


host = "myhost"
service = "MyService"
params = {
    "keyfoo": "valuebar"
}
generic_myservice_client = grpc_reflection_interface.make_json_grpc_client(host, service)

my_grpc_response = generic_myservice_client["my_grpc_method"](params)
```
